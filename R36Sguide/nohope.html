    <p>You unfortunately bought the worst of the worst clones. It uses a chipset even weaker than the original R36S, and even ArkOS (K36), which has been patched to work on many clones, cannot be installed on it. As of now, there is not a single firmware available that works with it. So technically, this isn’t really an R36S — it’s closer to a GB350.</p>
    <p2>throw it or request a refund and return without hesitation.</p2>
